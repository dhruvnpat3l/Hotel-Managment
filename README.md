Bootstrap v5.3.3: For the responsive grid system, pre-styled components (navbar, cards, modals, forms), and utility classes.

Bootstrap Icons v1.11.3: For clean and scalable vector icons used throughout the site.

Google Fonts: For elegant typography (Playfair Display for headings and Roboto for body text).

JavaScript: For enabling Bootstrap components and handling simple DOM manipulations like the fade-in-on-scroll animation.
